    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Nickolas and I am a senior Computer Science student at Angelo State University.
      I currently work for I.T. on campus as a Server Technician, and will be graduating in December of 2019.
      My resume can be found here: <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume.pdf</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is a work in progress for CS4312: Internet Technologies.
      I have created websites before, however I have never used PHP so I expect to learn quite a bit in this class.
      Some examples of websites I have created would include <a href="https://nickolas.gupton.xyz" target="_blank">my personal website</a> and the ones for CS3312: Web Programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some hobbies of mine would include open source programming, playing pool, and playing video games.
      I watch various news sites and YouTube channels to stay up to date on these, 
      however I would say the one I check the most is <a href="https://level1techs.com/article" target="_blank">Level1Techs</a>, 
      as they always seem to be extremely up to date on various tech topics with little bias.
    </p>
